# NOTES:
#    ADAPTIVE OPENING: Pink region marking uses density-based kernel sizing
#   * >=25% non-transparent pixels -> 10% of min(width,height) as kernel size
#   * <25% non-transparent pixels -> Linear scaling down to 1% minimum
#   * Formula: opening_percentage = min_percentage + (density/max_density) * (max_percentage - min_percentage)
# 
#   DYNAMIC THORNFIDDLE: Golden lobe detection uses LMC shape-based kernel sizing
#   * Dynamic opening percentage is calculated using: LMC_ShapeIndex with linear interpolation
#   * Dynamic kernel size = (dynamic_percentage / 100.0) * LMC_SHORTER_dimension
#   * For circular leaves (LMC_ShapeIndex = 1.0): uses thornfiddle_max_opening_percentage of LMC shorter dimension
#   * For elongated leaves (LMC_ShapeIndex >= 5.0): uses thornfiddle_min_opening_percentage of LMC shorter dimension
#   * This ensures kernel size scales with actual leaf size AND never exceeds the narrow dimension
#   * PREVENTS DESTRUCTION of thin/narrow leaves by constraining kernel to the limiting dimension
#
#   ENHANCEMENT: Principled approach based on geometric properties
#   * Enhancement Richness: N_h = floor(N_max * (L_seg / C_leaf)) - number of harmonics proportional to segment size
#   * Enhancement Intensity: W_pos increases linearly from 0 at segment start to 1 at deepest point
#   * Harmonic Series: Enhancement = W_pos * Σ (1/k) * sin(2π * k * f_base * L_pos) from k=1 to N_h
#   * Base frequency normalized by leaf circumference for scale invariance
#   * Eliminates magic numbers and complex "chaos factors" - purely geometric approach
#
#   CONTINUOUS SPECTRAL ENTROPY SCALING:
#   * S(CV) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (CV - c))) where CV is coefficient of variation
#   * Final entropy = H_spectral × S(CV) - prevents artifacts from low-amplitude noise
#   * Continuous scaling eliminates discontinuities between leaves with similar complexity
#   * k controls transition steepness, c controls transition center point
